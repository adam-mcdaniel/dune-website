# THE DUNE SHELL
*A shell🐚 by the beach🏖️!*

Dune is a shell designed for powerful scripting. Think of it as an unholy combination of `bash` and **Lisp**.

You can do all the normal shell operations like piping, file redirection, and running programs. *But*, you also have access to a standard library and functional programming abstractions for various programming and sysadmin tasks!
